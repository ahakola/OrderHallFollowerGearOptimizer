# OrderHallFollowerGearOptimizer

OrderHallFollowerGearOptimizer is a fan update of FollowerGearOptimizer by [Sortokk](https://wow.curseforge.com/profiles/nynjamonkii/) and I have asked and recieved permission from him to publish this fan update as an addon.

The OrderHallFollowerGearOptimizer is edited version of FollowerGearOptimizer designed to help you managing your Order Hall followers.

Quote from original FollowerGearOptimizer:
> Sitting on 30 follower upgrade tokens and don't know where you want to spend them? The FollowerGearOptimizer can help!! The optimizer takes a weighted list of your followers (based on how many you have that can counter each threat), then randomly chooses as many followers as it can to get to the target ilevel. You can keep asking it to reach a target ilevel and it will generate a new random list of followers to upgrade every time, again based on this weighted distribution. Once you're happy with the targeted followers, click the Apply button, and an item button will show allowing you to apply each of the generated upgrade tokens to the designated follower. Once youre finished, your followers will now match the item level the optimizer had shown you and you no longer need worry about those item tokens taking up your precious bag space.

> Click on your command table, go to the Followers tab, and click Optimize to get started.

Note: The optimize frame will only show if you have followers that are at level 110, below item level 850 (the current cap), not on a mission, and depending on options, not combat ally or inactive and you have upgrade tokens you can use in your bags. So if you have 10 level 110 followers at ilvl 850, or they are all on mission/working/inactive (with default settings) you won't see the button, and if you have no level 110s in your active group, you will receive an error message and the frame won't show.

If you are getting empty results, it means you followers are already either over the target item level or you don't have enough upgrade items to upgrade follower to target item level. You can disabe "*Upgrade follower only if they meet target item level*" setting to get suggestions even when you don't have enough upgrade items to fully upgrade to the target item level. After getting all of your active followers to maximum item level you can disable "*Ignore Combat Ally Followers*" and "*Ignore Inactive Followers*" settings to upgrade your remaining followers.

The addon manages only item level upgrades, not the "*Champion Equipment*" items.
